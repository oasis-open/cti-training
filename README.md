<h2><a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a></h2>

<p>Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository (cti-training) as <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti/201804/msg00000.html">proposed</a> [<a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti/201804/msg00001.html">bis</a>] and <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti/201804/msg00007.html">approved</a> [<a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2870">bis</a>] by the TC:</p>

<p>The purpose of this GitHub public repository is to support collaboration on a collection of CTI-related training materials.</p>

<p>The purpose of the OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee is "to define a set of information representations and protocols to address the need to model, analyze, and share cyber threat intelligence. A composable set of information sharing services is being defined to enable peer-to-peer, hub and spoke, and source subscriber threat intelligence sharing models...</p>

<p>Effective defense against current and future threats also requires the addition of an outward focus on understanding the adversary's behavior, capability, and intent. Only through a balanced understanding of both the adversary and ourselves can we understand enough about the true nature of the threats we face to make intelligent defensive decisions. The development of this understanding is known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI)." [from the CTI TC <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/charter.php">Charter</a>]</p>
